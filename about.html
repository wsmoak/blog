<p>I'm a
<a target="new" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html"> member</a>
of The Apache Software Foundation where I have spent
<a target="new" href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=wendy+smoak">countless hours</a>
answering questions, writing documentation, and managing releases for
build automation tools Maven, Continuum and Archiva as well as web application
frameworks Struts, Shale and MyFaces.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="https://www.chargify.com">Chargify</a>, helping people get the most out of our subscription management and recurring billing system.</p>

<p>I can usually be found on <a target="new" href="http://webchat.freenode.net">Freenode IRC</a> as wsmoak. Lately I've been spending time in
  <ul>
    <!--<li>#growstuff, working on feature testing for <a href="http://growstuff.org">
  an open source platform to track what you plant and harvest</a>.</li>-->
    <li>##sublimetext, and</li>
    <li>#elixir-lang, learning about Elixir and Phoenix.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>In addition to the posts here, the <a target="new" href="http://wiki.wsmoak.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RecentChanges">Recent Changes</a>
  page of my wiki will give you a hint about what I've been working on.

<p>I live on a farm in Georgia, where I enjoy vegetable gardening, raising chickens for eggs and meat, and horseback riding.</p>
